A plugin for the D3 Library using the Partition layout.

To Do:

1. (for all these plugins) tooltip functionality

2. Decide what kind of animation I want. Should d.x0 = d.x or should it be d.x0 = 0?

3. next year I'm going to make a function that will transition from one attribute of the data set to another. This will have the nice animation from the example

4. data parsing might need to be looked at too?

5. this wouold be a cool idea: make the children clickable and then transform the chart into the sub-set of data. leave the center circle in so that the user can click on it to go back up the data set. noice!
